#### About:
COVID 19 dataset fetch from John Hopkins Uni. deployed on heroku using FLASK/DASH. Covid struck the whole world, so I decided to contribute (atleast info wise).
What I represented in this work is purely educational/informational. I researched Johns Hopkins dataset in their public, open to use repository, pulled their repo, churend/squeezed/parsed/douged :blush: plotted thier data in a meaningful/ easy to grasp fashion using Dash/plottely/Flask. Datascience stacks I used are Pnadas/Numpy. A little bit sprinkle of HTML and CSS is also there. Finally,  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DeployedOn-Heroku-informational?style=flat&logo=Heroku&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) . The work is inspired by Meinhard Ploners git hub repo: https://github.com/ploner/coronavirus-py
